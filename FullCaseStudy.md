## Business Viewpoint Analysis - by Kishaylin Reddy

### Describing the Business Viewpoint Analysis

In the ever-evolving world of business, social media has constantly and effortlessly reshaped the business world by introducing a platform that connects over 5 billion users globally, where consumers and businesses can interact with each other virtually online while also giving businesses an opportunity to interact with their competitors in real time. Social media is an informative and important tool that businesses need in our world today, to advertise their products effectively, expand their markets and smooth operations, however businesses can be led down a different path, where the outcomes of their impact are unknown that may lead to reputation damage, cybersecurity threats and not knowing who their target audience really are.   

### Positive Business Impacts 

#### Market Expansion

Businesses can advertise their products to a wider audience of people and expand their markets across the globe at a minimal cost. Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, allow companies to present their products to an audience of diverse backgrounds for them to view.  

Due to this, this has led to the expansion of international markets of all business sizes, allowing them to engage with their customers in just a few swipes.  Popular streaming platform Netflix and sensational accommodation app Airbnb are two examples of businesses that have personalized their content on social media, by posting about the range of different localities and genres and adapting it to certain cultures, languages and societal norms which effectively attracted people from around the world.

#### Customer Engagement 

Interacting in real time with businesses makes the business experience seem more humanised. According to Teleprompter.com (2025), *“78% of consumers prefer short-form video for product discovery”* in 2025 as these types of videos fosters the business brand to be more relatable and approachable to consumers.  

Apart from the videos, consumers can find all the essential details about the business such as the contact details, specials and deals and website links, making it easier to locate information all in one sitting, to become more accessible to their customers.  

#### Environmentally Friendly with Low Costs 

Marketing products tend to be more cost effective as it is much cheaper to advertise online rather than using other advertising mediums such as posters and flyers, which costs much more. Not only is this cost effective, but it also lowers the company’s environmental impact.  

Social media does not require any paper; therefore, fewer trees are being cut down; less greenhouse gas emissions are released from manufacturing plants, and they do not have any transportation costs associated with it, therefore makes the business more sustainable and environmentally friendly.  

#### Monitoring Competitors at Ease 

Competitors can be easily watched and tracked through social media on their release of products and their price ranges, making it easier for businesses to keep up with new trends and be more appealing and competitive.  

A real-life example of this would be the grocery retailer, Tesco, keeping up to date with Aldi, one of their competitors. By paying attention to their products, they apply the same prices to their own products and advertise it as *"Aldi Price Match"* to consumers, emphasizing the great quality of goods at a reasonable price tag.  

 

### Negative Business Impacts 

#### Reputational Risks 

A business’s reputation is extremely valuable; however, it can easily be damaged, such as posting an image that may be highly controversial or dishonest in any form, which can be detrimental.  

A few years ago, the most known and loved fashion brands Zara, H&M & Uniqlo, to name a few, were called out for their misleading information on their environmental efforts and were criticized for greenwashing, leading to reputational damages and disheartened environmentally conscious consumers. 

#### Cybersecurity Threats  

Social Media Business Accounts are prone to cybersecurity issues and cyber-attacks due to the highly confidential data that can be lost and stolen.  

Hulsey (2024) reported that *“there were 3,205 data compromises in 2023, impacting 353 million total victims”* which emphasizes that these attacks not only take the sensitive data along with them, but erodes the brand trust and transparency.  

#### A Challenging Audience  

People can be difficult to please and due to this, businesses cannot control their audiences’ viewpoints as they all may have mixed opinions about their products, which can negatively affect their brand image and engagement with their audience.  

Poor reviews, negative comments and damaging posts shift businesses in a different spotlight that can cause serious consequences if ignored.  

#### Digital Divide 

Businesses may find it difficult to promote their products to a target audience of people who may not use Social Media apps, find difficulties using them or have no access to social media at all, which causes businesses to find alternative ways to reach them, resorting to costly ventures. 

According to Petrosyan (2025), *“5.66 billion, or 68.7% of the world's population, were social media users”* in 2025, which leads to 31.3% of people globally who do not use social media. This figure is nearly one third of the world's population, identifying it as a serious challenge. 

### Connection to Module concepts 

This analysis demonstrates the Business Perspective, illustrating that technology like social media platforms create effective ways to assist business needs, however, has many risks associated with it. It collides with the module concepts of computing for businesses, data privacy, ethical awareness covered in Week 7 and touches on the impact of the digital divide covered from Week 3.  


## Societal Viewpoint Analysis

### Introduction to Societal viewpoint analysis 

From the introduction of social media apps, the lives of people have changed drastically from the way we communicate, interact, and the way we can connect to people from around the world. Social media has brought many advantages and disadvantages effects on society. 

### Advantages in Society 

## Communication
One of the most amazing changes is the difference between the old and the new way of communication, now we can communicate with our friends and families just by clicking some application on our phone like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook or Discord, but before it was different, they used letters or old rotary phones to communicate with their parents or friends, it was slow compared to nowadays form of communication but also functional. 

 
## Changes in the way we live
Another thing that has changed is how we manage our activities like booking a hotel for holiday, paying rent and bills, finding jobs and the possibility to learn new skills, almost everything can be done online nowadays, this made the people be less stressed because it’s less time consuming and have less worries about not paying in time. 

 

## Opportunities
Another change that made the society change is that now more people have the opportunity to change their life because of social media, they can become influencer, open an e-commerce where they can sell their own goods easily or create an online business that gives the user a service like a streaming platform where they can pay and watch movies or series. 

 

After the full introduction of social media, society changed in a way that the people who worked in this sector did not expect. 

## Disadvantages in Society

## Laziness in Society 
According to the article wrote by Carson Wulf (2021) “Is the Internet making People Lazy?”, social media is making people more prone to laziness. This can be seen more in teenagers than adults. The reason to why, is that social media apps are becoming more addictive like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube and not only that is the cause of being lazy, because of the fact that we are able to talk with people by calling them even if they are far away, teenagers spends a lot of time playing video games while talking to their friends, and this is promoting them to procrastination if not controlled by their parents. 

 
## Depression in Society
On the internet everything can happen like Cyber Bullying or death threats, if these issues are not moderated by those who works in social media apps or by the parents, these can lead to depression, anxiety or even worse to the people who suffers from it. 
Fear of Missing Out(FOMO), this when people start scrolling on news and videos because they fear to miss out on information or what other people are doing like trends on social media, and this can lead to anxiety and waste of time. 

 
## Misinformation in Society 
Misinformation can easily happen on the internet, this can be a mistake or a voluntary action made by someone who want to see conflicts between communities, this a huge threat to society since most of the people get their information on social media and this can lead to different events like hospitalizations, because they consumed something not edible that someone on the internet said it was, money scams because they may have pressed on a link while trying to look for something on the internet and they got their bank details stolen because of it, this can also  happen by call if they ask you for your bank details when they try to impersonate the customer service of a big company. 

 

### Impact of an Influencer 
An influencer can affect society in a positive or negative way, it depends on the person and how famous they are. 

## Negative

An influencer can promote bad things like gambling, misinformation, harmful product and unethical behaviors. 
A lot of times the influencers will deceive his fans by showing them their false personality online while hiding their true personality in real life, they mostly do this for money and they are mainly followed by teenagers, because of this most influencer ended their career because of the change of the public opinion when they discover who they truly are, and sometimes this can become a topic for some news stations. 
There was an incident where a streamer did a giveaway in Manhattan’s Union Square Park, almost 2000 people showed up, this event led to vandalism and public aggression. This shows how damaging an online influencer may be if events like this are not controlled.  

 
## Positive

There are some influencers who helps his fans by giving them advice for real life situations and they are mostly loved by the elderly and families, they can change their follower’s opinions easily but it is something that they rarely do, these influencer are the one who contributes the most in charities and helps the people on social media to be better. 

Influencers are able to control almost all their fans to do certain things. If he asks to help another influencer become famous on social media, most of his followers will try to make him famous. They can also collaborate with brands to make him more money while increasing the credibility of that brand in his community.

## connection to module
This viewpoint analysis demonstrate how technology has advanced and how it affected the society by showing the advantages and disadvantages. This analysis can be associated with some concepts of the module, like opportunity to open new online businesses, data are very sensitive while exploring on the internet and how communication has changed the society. 

## Ethical Reflection - by Jomehl Real 

Social media has brought many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global scale through the use of the internet. You can access information about businesses and events in the blink of an eye. However, this comes with many challenges from an ethical standpoint.

**Privacy**

Privacy is constantly being challenged. Massive amounts of data are being harvested by websites and the general public don't know where that data is going or who's able to see it, creating an ethical dilemma where a user decides whether to use a website's services or not. A study conducted in 2024 shows that 80% of the general population feel uneasy and wish that they knew more about how their personal data is being used online (Harmeling, T. 2025). 

GDPR laws exist to protect users' privacy in the EU by giving clear guidelines to organisations on how to process user data. Failing to comply will result in fines of up to €20 million or a ban from processing data, which is a core component of all social media platforms. These laws incentivise businesses to be compliant but it's also important for the public to know their rights. Implementing these laws globally would be worthwhile for society. Spreading awareness of GDPR through interactive workshops and quizzes, and integrating it into everyday life (eg. adding a QR code to coffee cups, posters in schools or work, etc.) may lessen the unease among the population. 

**Fake News**

Another major ethical issue is the spread of fake news. Tabloids and dedicated social media accounts constantly spread false information in order to trigger a reaction, usually for nefarious reasons. This information then spreads across communities and becomes an issue that often have a negative impact. In a report by Vosoughi et al. (2018), it was found that fake news spreads more rapidly than true news on twitter.

The spread of fake news could be solved with better education based on critical thinking. Learning how to think for yourself can greatly improve how you perceive information, giving you the capability to better differentiate whether information is factual or not. Twitter has a feature called "Community Notes" which allow users to confirm the validity of a post. This is based on a rating system where users can vote if the note is helpful or not. Implementing this into other social media websites could be beneficial.

**Accountability**

There isn't enough accountability held when it comes to algorithmic decision making. Sites like Facebook and Instagram use algorithms to show users content based on their interests. This business tactic encourages users to stay on the platform longer. However, this creates several issues, like screen addiction and the rapid spread of fake news. In some cases, it has even influenced political events and election outcomes. Political parties can pay platforms to use targeted algorithms to push their campaigns. A Pew Research Center study by Barthel M. et al. (2016) found that ‘about two-in-three U.S. adults (64%) say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.’ 

Social media algorithm regulation is still in its infancy. In America, the Algorithmic Accountability Act has recently been proposed. Similar to GDPR, it would hold companies accountable for transparency of their algorithms. In the EU, the Digital Services Act aims to protect user rights by forcing companies to provide statements on how their algorithms function, and these statements are recorded in a public database. These acts indicate a shift in algorithmic regulation which will increase in importance as machine learning algorithms become more common.


## Conclusion

Social Media has a firm holding in today's society. It evolved from early platforms that laid the foundation for today's social media giants that have each carved out their own niche. While having many benefits for both businesses and society, social media is not without its problems and ethical concerns.

Through social media, businesses are able to advertise to a broader audience. Short form and organic content is more accessible for customers, and can be lower cost and have environmental benefits than traditional advertising. However, there are potential business risks that come with social media including cybersecurity threats, review bombing and a digital divide.   

For society, social media has brought new levels of communication and transformed how we manage different everyday tasks, and even created new money-making opportunities. Unfortunately, society has also suffered negative impacts from social media, including a rise in laziness and depression, spread of misinformation, and issues with online harassment. 

Other ethical concerns around privacy and accountability bring into question the laws surrounding social media. Ultimately, the use of social media will continue to play a significant role in our daily lives. While governing bodies have a responsibility to hold companies accountable, we also need to educate ourselves and our peers. Society must learn to evolve with the fast-growing progress of technology.
