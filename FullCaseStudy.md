## Ethical Reflection - by Jomehl Real 

Social media has brought many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global scale through the use of the internet. You can access information about businesses and events in the blink of an eye. However, this comes with many challenges from an ethical standpoint.

**Privacy**

Privacy is constantly being challenged. Massive amounts of data are being harvested by websites and the general public don't know where that data is going or who's able to see it, creating an ethical dilemma where a user decides whether to use a website's services or not. A study conducted in 2024 shows that 80% of the general population feel uneasy and wish that they knew more about how their personal data is being used online (Harmeling, T. 2025). 

GDPR laws exist to protect users' privacy in the EU by giving clear guidelines to organisations on how to process user data. Failing to comply will result in fines of up to €20 million or a ban from processing data, which is a core component of all social media platforms. These laws incentivise businesses to be compliant but it's also important for the public to know their rights. Spreading awareness of GDPR through interactive workshops and quizzes, and integrating it into everyday life (eg. adding a QR code to coffee cups, posters in schools or work, etc.) may lessen the unease among the population. 

**Fake News**

Another major ethical issue is the spread of fake news. Tabloids and dedicated social media accounts constantly spread false information in order to trigger a reaction, usually for nefarious means. This information then spreads across communities and becomes an issue that often have a negative impact. In a report by Vosoughi et al. (2018), it was found that fake news spreads more rapidly than true news on twitter.

The spread of fake news could be solved with better education based on critical thinking. Learning how to think for yourself can greatly improve how you perceive information, giving you the capability to better differentiate whether information is factual or not. Twitter has a feature called "Community Notes" which allow users to confirm the validity of a post. This is based on a rating system where users can vote if the note is helpful or not. Implementing this into other social media websites could be beneficial.

**Accountability**

There isn't enough accountability held when it comes to algorithmic decision making. Sites like Facebook and Instagram use algorithms to show users content based on their interests. This business tactic encourages users to stay on the platform longer. However, this creates several issues, like screen addiction and the rapid spread of fake news. In some cases, it has even influenced political events and election outcomes. Political parties can pay platforms to used targeted algorithms to push their campaigns. A Pew Research Center study by Barthel M. et al. (2016) found that ‘about two-in-three U.S. adults (64%) say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.’ 

Social media algorithm regulation is still in its infancy. In America, the Algorithmic Accountability Act has recently been proposed. Similar to GDPR, it would hold companies accountable for transparency of their algorithms. In the EU, the Digital Services Act aims to protect user rights by forcing companies to provide statements on how their algorithms function, and these statements are recorded in a public database. These acts indicate a shift in algorithmic regulation which will increase in importance as machine learning algorithms become more common.


## Conclusion

Social Media has a firm holding in today's society. It evolved from early platforms that laid the foundation for today's social media giants that have each carved out their own niche. While having many benefits for both businesses and society, social media is not without its problems and ethical concerns.

Through social media, businesses are able to advertise to a broader audience. Short form and organic content is more accessible for customers, and can be lower cost and have environmental benefits than traditional advertising. However, there are potential business risks that come with social media including cybersecurity threats, review bombing and a digital divide.   

For society, social media has brought new levels of communication and transformed how we manage different everyday tasks, and even created new money-making opportunities. Unfortunately, society has also suffered negative impacts from social media, including a rise in laziness and depression, spread of misinformation, and issues with online harassment. 

Other ethical concerns around privacy and accountability bring into question the laws surrounding social media. Ultimately, the use of social media will continue to play a significant role in our daily lives. While governing bodies have a responsibility to hold companies accountable, we also need to educate ourselves and our peers. Society must learn to evolve with the fast-growing progress of technology.
