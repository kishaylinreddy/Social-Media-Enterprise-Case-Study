## Ethical Reflection - by Jomehl Real ##

Social media has brought many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global scale through the use of the internet. You can access information about businesses and events in the blink of an eye. However, this comes with many challenges from an ethical standpoint.

**Privacy**

Privacy is constantly being challenged. Massive amounts of data are being harvested by websites and the general public don't know where that data is going or who is able to see it, creating an ethical dilemma where a user decides whether to use a website's services or not. A study conducted in 2024 shows that 80% of the general population feel uneasy and wish that they knew more about how their personal data is being used online (Harmeling, T. 2025). 

**Fake News**

Another major ethical issue is the spread of fake news. Tabloids and dedicated social media accounts constantly spread false information in order to trigger a reaction, usually for nefarious means. This information then spreads across communities and becomes an issue that often have a negative impact. In a report by Vosoughi et al. (2018), it was found that fake news spreads more rapidly than true news on twitter.

**Accountability**

This leads to another issue; there isn't enough accountability held when it comes to algorithmic decision making. Sights like Facebook and Instagram use algorithms that show users what they may want to see or what is currently trending. This makes sense from a business standpoint as the sights want you to use their services for as long as possible but it creates several issues, like screen addiction or fake news being spread rapidly. It can be as serious as influencing political election campaigns. By using target based algorithms, political parties can pay websites to push their campaigns. A Pew Research Center study by Barthel M. et al. (2016) found that ‘about two-in-three U.S. adults (64%) say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.’ False news being intentionally spread by political campaigns causes a great effect in the results of elections.

**Improvements**

Looking at these challenges, there may be ways that we can limit them. The current GDPR laws protects the user's(In the EU) privacy by giving clear guidelines to organisations on how to process the user's data. Failing to comply to these regulations will result in fines of up to €20 million or banning them from processing data, which could shutdown the company if they rely on user data. Continuing to enforce these laws will limit the issues we face with privacy. Spreading the awareness of GDPR with interactive workshops, quizzes and integrating it into everyday life (eg. adding a QR code to coffee cups, posters in schools or work, etc.) may lessen the anxiety among the population. 

The spread of fake news could be solved with better education based on critical thinking. Learning how to think for yourself can greatly improve how you perceive information, giving you the capability to better differentiate whether information is factual or not. Twitter has a feature called "Community Notes" which allow users to confirm the validity of a post. This is based on a rating system where users can vote if the note is helpful or not. Implementing this into other social media websites could be beneficial.

There needs to be better regulations on how algorithms are implemented in social media. In America, the Algorithmic Accountability Act has been introduced. Similar to GDPR, it would hold companies accountable for transparency of their algorithms and how it impacts consumers. In the EU, the Digital Services Act aim to protect user rights and to establish a level playing field for businesses in the EU or global market. They enact strict rules that companies must comply with. Companies must provide statements on how their algorithm functions, and these statements are recorded in a database where consumers can access if they wish. This is a step in the right direction and it needs to be commonplace in the ever evolving digital landscape.
