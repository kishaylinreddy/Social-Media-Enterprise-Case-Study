**Ethical reflection**

Social media has brought many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global scale through the use of the internet. You can access information about businesses and events in the blink of an eye. However, this comes with many challenges from an ethical standpoint.

Privacy is constantly being challenged. Massive amounts of data are being harvested by websites and the general public don't know where that data is going or who is able to see it, creating an ethical dilemma where a user decides whether to use a website's services or not. A study conducted in 2024 shows that 80% of the general population feel uneasy and wish that they knew more about how their personal data is being used online (Harmeling, T. 2025). 

Another major ethical issue is the spread of false news. Tabloids and dedicated social media accounts constantly spread false information in order to trigger a reaction, usually for nefarious means. This information then spreads across communities and becomes an issue that often have a negative impact. In a report by Vosoughi et al. (2018), it was found that false news spreads more rapidly than true news on twitter.

This leads to another issue; there isn't enough accountability held when it comes to algorithmic decision making. Sights like Facebook and Instagram use algorithms that show users what they may want to see or what is currently trending. This makes sense from a business standpoint as the sights want you to use their services for as long as possible but it creates several issues, like screen addiction or false news being spread rapidly. It can be as serious as influencing political election campaigns. By using target based algorithms, political parties can pay websites to push their campaigns.
