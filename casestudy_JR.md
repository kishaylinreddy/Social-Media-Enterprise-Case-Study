*Ethical reflection*

Social media brings many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global basis through the internet. It gives you easy access to information about local businesses, events and anything that may be of interest to the user. This of course has it's downsides from an ethical standpoint.

One of the biggest ethical challenges that social media faces is privacy. All of the user's data is stored in data centres that the social media companies utilise. When these data centres are breached, it could lead to sensitive information leaks(emails, names, locations, etc...), which could lead to identity theft, stalking and other issues that may affect the users.
