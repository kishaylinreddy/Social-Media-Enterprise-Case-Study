**Ethical reflection**

Social media has brought many benefits to people's lives. It allows us to connect with people on a global scale through the use of the internet. You can access information about businesses and events in the blink of an eye. This comes with many challenges from an ethical standpoint.

Privacy is constantly being challenged. Massive amounts of data are being harvested by websites and the general public don't know where that data is going or who is able to see it, creating an ethical dilemma where a user decides whether to use a website's services or not. A study conducted in 2024 shows that 80% of the general population feel uneasy and wish that they knew more about how their personal data is being used online (Harmeling, T. 2025).
