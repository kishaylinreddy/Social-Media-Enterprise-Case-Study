#Social Media Impacts
**Positive Business Impacts**  

Brands can advertise their products to a wider audience of people and expand their markets across the globe 

Increases customer engagement as they are interacting in real time with the business making it more humanized. 

Marketing products are more cost effective as it is much cheaper to advertise online rather than using other advertising mediums such as posters and flyers which costs much more 

Competitors can be easily watched and tracked through social media on their release of products and their price ranges making it easier for business to keep up with new trends and be more appealing  

 

**Negative Business Impacts** 

Business’s Reputation can easily be damaged such as by posting an image that may be highly controversial  

Cybersecurity issues as business social media accounts can be hacked and highly confidential data can be lost and stolen 

Cannot control the audiences’ viewpoints as they all may have mixed opinions about their products, which can negatively affect their brand image and engagement with their audience
