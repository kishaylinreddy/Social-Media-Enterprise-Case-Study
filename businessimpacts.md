## Social Media Impacts - Business View - Kishaylin Reddy

In the ever-evolving world of business, social media has constantly and effortlessly reshaped the business world by introducing a platform that connects over 5 billion users globally, where consumers and businesses can interact with each other virtually online while also giving businesses an opportunity to interact with their competitors in real time. Social media is an informative and important tool that businesses need in our world today, to advertise their products effectively, however businesses can be led down a different path, where the outcomes of their impact are unknown that may lead to reputation damage, cybersecurity threats and not knowing who their target audience really are. 

Brands can advertise their products to a wider audience of people and expand their markets across the globe. Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, allow companies to present their products to an audience of diverse backgrounds for them to view. Due to this, this has led to the expansion of international markets of all business sizes, allowing them to engage with their customers in just a few swipes. A recent case study published by Lee (2025) discusses a small business in Texas, USA gaining '2.3 million views' only 'within 48 hours' due to its social media marketing that increased their following massively.  

Apart from this, it also boosts customer engagement as they interact in real time with the business, making the business experience more humanized. About '78% of consumers prefer short-form video for product discovery' in 2025 as these types of videos appear to make the business more relatable and approachable to consumers. Other than videos, consumers can find all the details about the business such as the email address, phone number, specials and deals and website links, making it easier to locate information all in one sitting.  

Marketing products tend to be more cost effective as it is much cheaper to advertise online rather than using other advertising mediums such as posters and flyers, which costs much more. Not only is this cost effective, but it also lowers the company's environmental impact. Social media does not require any paper; therefore, fewer trees are being cut down and do not have any transportation costs associated with it like postal services to distribute the flyers.  

Competitors can be easily watched and tracked through social media on their release of products and their price ranges, making it easier for businesses to keep up with new trends and be more appealing and competitive.
