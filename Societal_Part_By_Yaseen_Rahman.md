Societal: 

From the introduction of social media apps, the lives of people have changed drastically from the way we communicate, interact, and the way we can connect to people from around the world. Social media has brought many advantages and disadvantages effects on society. 

Advantages in Society 

Communication: 
One of the most amazing changes is the difference between the old and the new way of communication, now we can communicate with our friends and families just by clicking some application on our phone like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook or Discord, but before it was different, they used letters or old rotary phones to communicate with their parents or friends, it was slow compared to nowadays form of communication but also functional. 

 

Changes in the way we live: 
Another thing that has changed is how we manage our activities like booking a hotel for holiday, paying rent and bills, finding jobs and the possibility to learn new skills, almost everything can be done online nowadays, this made the people be less stressed because it’s less time consuming and have less worries not paying in time. 

 

Opportunities: 
Another change that made the society change is that now more people have the opportunity to change their life because of social media, they can become influencer, open an e-commerce where they can sell their own goods easily or create an online business that gives the user a service like a streaming platform where they can pay and watch movies or series. 

 

After the full introduction of social media, society changed in a way that the people who worked in this sector did not expect. 

Disadvantages: 

Laziness in society: 
According to the article wrote by Carson Wulf (2021) “Is the Internet making People Lazy?”, social media is making people more prone to laziness. This can be seen more in teenagers than adults. The reason to why, is that social media apps are becoming more addictive like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube and not only that is the cause of being lazy, because of the fact that we are able to talk with people by calling them even if they are far away, teenagers spends a lot of time playing video games while talking to their friends, and this is promoting them to procrastination if not controlled by their parents. 

 

 

Depression in Society: 
On the internet everything can happen like Cyber Bullying or death threats, if these issues are not moderated by those who works in social media apps or by the parents, these can lead to depression, anxiety or even worse to the people who suffers from it. 
Fear of Missing Out(FOMO), this when people start scrolling on news and videos because they fear to miss out on information or what other people are doing like trends on social media, and this can lead to anxiety and waste of time. 

 

Misinformation in society:  
Misinformation can easily happen on the internet, this can be a mistake or a voluntary action made by someone who want to see conflicts between communities, this a huge threat to society since most of the people get their information on social media and this can lead to different events like hospitalizations, because they consumed something not edible that someone on the internet said it was, money scams because they may have pressed on a link while trying to look for something on the internet and they got their bank details stolen because of it, this can also  happen by call if they ask you for your bank details when they try to impersonate the customer service of a big company. 

 

Impact of an Influencer 
An influencer can affect society in a positive or negative way, it depends on the person and how famous they are. 

Negative: 
An influencer can promote bad things like gambling, misinformation, harmful product and unethical behaviors. 
A lot of times the influencers will deceive his fans by showing them their false personality online while hiding their true personality in real life, they mostly do this for money and they are mainly followed by teenagers, because of this most influencer ended their career because of the change of the public opinion when they discover who they truly are, and sometimes this can become a topic for some news stations. 
There was an incident where a streamer did a giveaway in Manhattan’s Union Square Park, almost 2000 people showed up, this event led to vandalism and public aggression. This shows how damaging an influencer may be if events like this are not controlled.  

Positive: 
There are some influencers who helps his fans by giving them advice for real life situations and they are mostly loved by the elderly and families, they can change their follower’s opinions easily but it is something that they rarely do, these influencer are the one who contributes the most in charities and helps the people on social media to be better. 
Influencers are able to control almost all their fans to do certain things. If he asks to help another influencer become big on social media, most of his followers will try to make him big. They can also collaborate with brands to make him more famous while increasing the credibility of that brand in his community.
